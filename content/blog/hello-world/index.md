## Make sure he survives

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the $ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $ future.

Here's a simple footnote,[^1] and here's a longer one.[^bignote]

[^1]: This is the first footnote.

[^bignote]: Here's one with multiple paragraphs and code.

    Indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.

    `{ my code }`

    Add as many paragraphs as you like.

$$
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty
    \hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}
    \,d\xi
$$

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[salted duck eggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).
<span class="marginnote">
            This is a margin note. Notice there isnâ€™t a number preceding the note.
          </span>

> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
> eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
> supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
> charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
> wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
> salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
> firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.
